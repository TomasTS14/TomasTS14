## About me ✏️ :
I'm Tomás	, currently studying a technical degree in Web Programming :technologist: in the CPIFP Piramide in Huesca . I would describe myself mostly as a curious person, eager to learn, experience and try out new things, be it in programming (one of my main hobbies along with painting 🖌️ and videogames 🎮) or in life in general.
I've lived in at least 8 different locations across 3 countries 🗺️, where i've faced new people, new cultures, and of course, new lenguages. This has made me someone really open to new and interesting challenges :fire:
In conclusion, I'd say im definitley a curious and ethusiastic person, which can sometimes make of me a quick learner. Although I'm just starting in the programming world

Currently, due to my studies and current interests im mainly focused on web technologies. Such as DBMS, relational and non-relational (**Mongo, Postgres or MySQL**),
frontend frameworks such as **React**, **bootstrap**. Backend technologies such as **Springboot** or **Express**. And deployment related technologies and enviroments such as **AWS**, **Docker** 🐳 or **Apache** and **NGINX** .

### Programming lenguages that i've used both in my free time and my studies are:
- Java. ☕
- Javascript. 
- Typescript.
- Python. 🐍

### Some small projects I've made are:
- https://tomasts14.github.io/biblioteca_react_bootstrap/  [^1]
[^1]:Small library book lending and retrieving site using a fake api with json-placeholder, react and react-bootstrap.

- https://tomasts14.github.io/Listacompra_react_css/ [^2]
